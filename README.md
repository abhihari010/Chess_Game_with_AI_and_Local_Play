This is a chess game I created utlizing the pygame library.

I implemented an AI into the game to allow for single play as well as the option to choose to play locally on your computer.

In order to play, you can download the code and run the main.py file in any IDE such as VSCode or PyCharm. Once doing so, you will be prompted with a screen to either play locally or against an AI,
and after choosing an option, get to playing!!
